/**
 *@class CYPlotView
 *
 *@short Generic data plotting widget.
 *
 *Widget for drawing plots. The basic idea behind CYPlotView is that
 *you don't have to worry about any transformation from your data's
 *natural units to screen pixel coordinates; this is handled internally
 *by the widget.
 *
 *Data to be plotted are represented by one or more instances of
 *CYPlotObject.  CYPlotObject contains a list of PointFs to be plotted
 *(again, in the data's natural units), as well as information about how
 *the data are to be rendered in the plot (i.e., as separate points or
 *connected by lines?  With what color and point style? etc).  See
 *CYPlotObject for more information.
 *
 *CYPlotView automatically adds axis labels with tickmarks and tick
 *labels.  These are encapsulated in the PlotAxis class.  All you have
 *to do is set the limits of the plotting area in data units, and
 *CYPlotView will figure out the optimal positions and labels for the
 *tickmarks on the axes.
 *
 *Example of usage:
 *
 * @code
CYPlotView *kpw = new CYPlotView( parent );
// setting our limits for the plot
kpw->setLimits( 1.0, 5.0, 1.0, 25.0 );

// creating a plot object whose points are connected by red lines ...
CYPlotObject *kpo = new CYPlotObject( Qt::red, CYPlotObject::Lines );
// ... adding some points to it ...
for ( float x = 1.0; x <= 5.0; x += 0.1 )
    kpo->addPoint( x, x*x );

// ... and adding the object to the plot widget
kpw->addPlotObject( kpo );
 * @endcode
 *
 *@note CYPlotView will take ownership of the objects added to it, so when
 *clearing the objects list (eg with removeAllPlotObjects()) any previous
 *reference to a CYPlotObject already added to a CYPlotView will be invalid.
 *You can disable this behavior by using setAutoDelete(false).
 *
